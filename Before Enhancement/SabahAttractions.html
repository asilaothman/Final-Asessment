It was created by live corals that grew on top of an extinct volcanic cone over thousands of years. Sipadan is one of the world's most spectacular scuba diving locations. Sipadan is Malaysia's only oceanic island, and the massive pillar that creates the atoll serves as a haven for a variety of sea creatures and fish.

The Tip of Borneo is a renowned tourist destination in Sabah, located in the Kudat district. The environment is beautiful, but you may not realise that the spot where you are standing was once a pirate watchtower hundreds of years ago. As a result, the Tip of Borneo is also known as Tanjung Simpang Mengayau, which translates to "the point where the war begins" (in Rungus language).</p>
