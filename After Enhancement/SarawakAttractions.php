Today, Astana Kuching is the official residence of the Governor of Sarawak, and therefore not open to visitors.

      <div class="rightDivision">
        <img src="images\semenggoh.jpg" alt="Semenggoh Nature Reserve">
        <button type="button">Semenggoh Nature Reserve</button>
        <p class="details">For over 20 years, the wardens at Semenggoh Nature Reserve have been training young orangutans, who had been orphaned or rescued from captivity, how to survive in the wild. The success of this programme has left the surrounding forest reserve with a thriving population of healthy adolescent and young adult orangutans, who are now breeding in the wild. The programme has since been transferred to Matang Wildlife Centre, but Semenggoh Nature Reserve is still home to its successful graduates, semi-wild orangutans and their babies. They spend most of their time roaming the forest but frequently come back to the Centre for a free meal. If it is the fruiting season in the forest, some or even all of them may not come to feed. This in itself is a good sign and another step on the way to full rehabilitation.</p>
